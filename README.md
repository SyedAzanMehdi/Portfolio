# React + Vite Template Project

This project is a minimal and modern React development setup using Vite, designed to provide fast development performance, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and clean project configuration with basic linting support.

It serves as an efficient starting point for building scalable React applications with optimized build tools and modern frontend workflows.

# Key Features

Fast Development Experience – Powered by Vite for rapid build and refresh cycles

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) – Enables instant UI updates during development

ESLint Integration – Provides code quality and style enforcement rules

Flexible Plugin Support – Includes official React plugins for modern tooling

# Available Plugins

React Plugin (Babel-based)

Uses Babel for fast refresh and compatibility support

React Plugin (SWC-based)

Uses SWC compiler for faster refresh performance

# React Compiler Note

The React Compiler is not enabled by default in this template due to its potential impact on development and build performance. It can be manually enabled when needed using official React documentation.

# Recommended Production Enhancements

Use TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability

Enable type-aware ESLint rules for improved code quality

Implement modular architecture for large-scale applications

# Purpose

This template is ideal for developers starting React projects who want a lightweight yet powerful development environment with modern frontend tooling.
